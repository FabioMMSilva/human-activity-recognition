## Introduction

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify the manner in which individuals performed barbell lifts based on sensor data.

## Data Preprocessing

```{r}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
set.seed(42)

# Load data
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA", "", "#DIV/0!"))
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv", na.strings = c("NA", "", "#DIV/0!"))

# Remove near-zero variance predictors
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[, -nzv]
testing <- testing[, -nzv]

# Remove columns with too many missing values
threshold <- 0.95
missing <- sapply(training, function(x) mean(is.na(x)))
training <- training[, missing < threshold]
testing <- testing[, names(training)[-ncol(training)]]

# Remove identification columns
training <- training[, !(names(training) %in% c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1",
                                                "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp",
                                                "new_window", "num_window"))]
testing <- testing[, !(names(testing) %in% c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1",
                                             "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp",
                                             "new_window", "num_window"))]
```

## Model Training

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
trainSet <- training[inTrain,]
valSet <- training[-inTrain,]

model <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=trainSet)
predictions <- predict(model, valSet)
confusionMatrix(predictions, valSet$classe)
```

## Final Predictions on Test Set

```{r}
final_predictions <- predict(model, testing)
final_predictions
```

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model achieved excellent performance and was used to classify 20 new test cases.
